Very modern and stylish interior with good food. Looks a little industrial (not family run) but has a modern and quant style. 

Their panini was very burnt on the outside, I would perhaps try the salads but Iâ€™d rather go to fezziwigs for panini. They took a while to get the sandwich too.

(This place is now out of business)
