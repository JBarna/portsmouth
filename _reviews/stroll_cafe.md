Very nice cafe, it seems a little more industrialized, kind of like tatte without the kitchen back there. They definitely don’t make their own pastries although they have some for sale. They also do breakfast sandwiches and lunch food. Their food is really cheap, might be worth it checking it out. Pretty spacious place too and the inside is nice and not dark. They have a large section with other drinks, juices, sparkling water, so this would be good for someone who might not want coffee
