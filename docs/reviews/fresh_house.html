    <p>Very modern and stylish interior with good food. Looks a little industrial (not family run) but has a modern and quant style.</p>

<p>Their panini was very burnt on the outside, I would perhaps try the salads but Iâ€™d rather go to fezziwigs for panini. They took a while to get the sandwich too.</p>

<p>(This place is now out of business)</p>
